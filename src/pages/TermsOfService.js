              <p>
                LFToolbox and the materials in LFToolbox and on our website are
                provided on an 'as is' basis. To the extent permitted by law,
                MadStoneDev makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and
                hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including,
                without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of
                merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
                non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation of
                rights.
              </p>
              <p>
                In no event shall MadStoneDev or its suppliers be liable for any
                consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third
                party arising from the use or inability to use LFToolbox, our
                website, or any other services provided by MadStoneDev or the
                materials in LFToolbox, even if MadStoneDev or an authorised
                representative has been notified, orally or in writing, of the
                possibility of such damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the context of this agreement, &quot;consequential loss&quot;
                includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or
                anticipated loss of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue,
                loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of
                savings, loss of reputation, loss of use and/or loss or
                corruption of data, whether under statute, contract, equity,
                tort (including negligence), indemnity or otherwise.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
                warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
                incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
